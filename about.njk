            About me
        </h2>
        <p class="about_desc">
            As a minimalist graphic designer, I bring a fresh and modern approach to design. With over four years of experience since I got my first laptop in 2017, I have honed my skills in graphic design, motion graphics, and digital art. Additionally, I offer website design and development services. My passion for working with colors, type, and illustrations is complemented by my deep understanding of typography, color theory, layout, and design fundamentals. I am constantly learning and seeking new challenges to enhance my skills. Let's collaborate and bring your vision to life!
